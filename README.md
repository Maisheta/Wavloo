# Wavlo 💬🤟

AI-powered Chat App that bridges communication gaps between Deaf, Mute, and hearing users through speech, text, and sign language translation.

Wavlo empowers seamless communication for everyone — integrating voice-to-text, text-to-speech, and real-time sign language recognition to create an inclusive messaging experience for all 🌍


# 💡 What is Wavlo?

Wavlo is an accessibility-first chat app that goes beyond typical messaging:

🎤 Convert voice messages into text — making conversations accessible for the hearing-impaired
🔈 Transform text into speech — helping users with speech or reading difficulties
🎥 Record sign language videos — Wavlo translates them into written messages using AI
💬 Chat just like WhatsApp — private, fast, and mobile-friendly

# 🤟 Real-Time Sign Language to Text
This is one of Wavlo’s most innovative features. The app uses your device’s camera and real-time AI recognition to convert sign language gestures into written text — live, as the user signs each letter or word.

How it Works:
📷 The user opens the camera inside the app and starts signing using hand gestures.

🧠 The AI model processes each gesture in real-time, detecting letters as they are signed.

📝 As each gesture is recognized, the corresponding character appears instantly on the screen like live typing.

✍️ The user continues signing until their message is complete.

📩 Once done, they tap Send and the message is delivered through the chat like a normal text.

Example Flow:
The user signs: H – E – L – L – O

The screen displays: "Hello"

Tap Send, and the message is sent in the chat.

This real-time recognition system allows for fast, fluid communication without the need to record full videos — making Wavlo a powerful and inclusive tool for the Deaf and Mute community.
